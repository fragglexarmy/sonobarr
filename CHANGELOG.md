## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-09
### Added
- Optional per-user Last.fm, YouTube, and LLM API settings in Profile for both password and OIDC accounts, with global defaults when personal settings are absent.
- Per-user LLM model, extra headers, and seed limit overrides, plus support for personal keyless LLM endpoints.
- Automated pytest suite for core services, web/API routes, OIDC flows, and socket handlers.
- Coverage tooling configuration (`pytest.ini`) and coverage report generation (`coverage.xml`) workflow documentation.

### Fixed
- OIDC login for providers that supply email or username at the UserInfo endpoint instead of in the ID token, while preserving support for embedded profile claims.

### Security
- Validate fetched UserInfo subjects against the authenticated ID-token subject before accepting profile claims.
- Keep global LLM credentials and authentication headers isolated from user-configured LLM endpoints.

### Changed
- Add a database migration for personal API settings; existing users retain global defaults until they configure overrides.
- Complete code refactor to comply with several Sonarqube reports (Security hotspots, maintainability and reliability).
- Updated README and technical docs to reflect automated testing and coverage workflow.
